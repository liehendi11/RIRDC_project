https://lens.org/024-958-461-911-218	2017-04-25	Blockchain Identity Management System Based On Public Identities Ledger	"The invention describes an identity management system (IDMS) based on the concept of peer-to-peer protocols and the public identities ledger. The system manages digital identities, which are digital objects that contain attributes used for the identification of persons and other entities in an IT system and for making identity claims. The identity objects are encoded and cryptographically encapsulated. Identity management protocols include the creation of identities, the validation of their binding to real-world entities, and their secure and reliable storage, protection, distribution, verification, updates, and use. The identities are included in a specially constructed global, distributed, append-only public identities ledger. They are forward- and backward-linked using the mechanism of digital signatures. The linking of objects and their chaining in the ledger is based on and reflect their mutual validation relationships. The identities of individual members are organized in the form of linked structures called the personal identities chains. Identities of groups of users that validated identities of other users in a group are organized in community identities chains. The ledger and its chains support accurate and reliable validation of identities by other members of the system and by application services providers without the assistance of third parties. The ledger designed in this invention may be either permissioned or unpermissioned. Permissioned ledgers have special entities, called BIX Security Policy Providers, which validate the binding of digital identities to real-world entities based on the rules of a given security policy. In unpermissioned ledgers, community members mutually validate their identities. The identity management system provides security, privacy, and anonymity for digital identities and satisfies the requirements for decentralized, anonymous identities management systems."			US

One context is when a user sends a linket to the Registry to get the deep link. The Registry replies with the deep link and an ad. The Registry can send an ad, akin to an interstitial ad for web pages. Only when the user removes the ad does the Registry send the deep link. Another context is where a linket owner migrates from app Alpha to app Beta. The Registry lets competitors make ads shown to users around the transition. The ads are grouped automatically into cases like where a competitor recommends her linket that continues to use Alpha. Appeals to users reluctant to transition from Alpha. A second case is for a competitor with a linket already using Beta. This competitor can claim to be more experienced with it than the linket owner. A third case is for a competitor with an app different from Alpha or Beta. The Registry can also show ads when a linket is deleted. The ads are for competing linkets. The attraction is that the ads do not have direct competition from the deleted linket."			US

To minimise delays, the virtual machines are in the same data center. If the app server hosts streaming apps, the app store might migrate the virtual machines to the data center of the app server, if this reduces the total latency between the user devices. A web page at an URL Phi can contain a linket Theta. Phi is seen in a mobile browser. If Theta is picked, the mobile device sends Theta and Phi to the Registry. The Registry logs both. Future analysis of the log tells where (Phi) the linket appeared. A bidirectional capability. The app server for the linket can also get Phi, and use the pair for similar analysis. An ad server which made an ad containing Theta, which appeared in Phi, can analyse the log to measure the efficacy of posting the ad to Theta. Phi can also be an app. An extension is where Phi has a parameter indicating the ?page? or data file in its database in which the linket is in. A deep link can have a phone number instead of an Internet address. If the phone accesses the Internet via a phone carrier, then a device getting the deep link can ask the carrier for the Internet address that it assigned to the phone. Or if the phone uses a hot spot, the device can ask the carrier, which in turn asks the phone for the Internet address that it got from the hot spot. The phone tells the carrier, which tells the device. In both cases, once the device gets the address, it can use this with the app id from the deep link to contact the phone across the Internet."

A deep link is at minimum 2 items. An id of an app and a network address or domain where the app is run. A Registry maps from a linket to a deep link. A linket owner defines a group of apps and a group id. The linket maps to a deep link that uses the group id instead of an id of a specific app. The apps in the group might be run in student mode. The address in the deep link is of an instance of another app that acts as a teacher or instructor. A group can have subgroups. This can be used to download app ids suitable for different mobile platforms, such that a mobile device can parse the appropriate ids for itself. An ad server that sends ads to 2 instances (on different devices) of an app can send an ad to only one instance. The latter shows the ad on its device and also forwards it to the other instance. This reduces the outgoing bandwidth on the ad server by half. If the user of the first device picks an item on the first ad, this choice can be sent to and shown on the second ad. A game can be played between the ad instances, independent of the underlying interactions between the app instances. A person using an app in a multi-user interaction with other persons can hand off her instance to someone. She makes a deep link that has an id of her app instance, known the app server. The deep link is sent to another person not currently in the interaction. His device decodes the deep link and presents it wirelessly to the server. The server transfers her ?game position? to the network address of his device. He can play her position in the interaction."			US

"This blockchain digital mine discovery innovation actually discovers more digital mines while it uses the blockchain as the rails and a secondary digital mine discovery process to discover secondary digital mines. The 2nd digital mine discovers a 3rd digital mine and then a 4th then 5th which can continue discoveries indefinitely perpetual automatically all from the digital mines discovered before them.

This is not a crypto currency nor is it an asset/commodity innovation that earns interest. What we have discovered on the blockchain is an actual digital mine we can call the master franchise which can actually discover new digital mines at a pre-determined discovery percentage rate example 1/10th per annum. It is estimated because mine discovery is not an exact science. This innovation is an actual digital mine discovery innovation on the blockchain which by default means it is covered under the realestate banner and in doing so we have worked out through our modelling that it can be an actual franchise. The master franchise is discovered the moment we find it and from there subsequent franchises with the same ability are discovered and then allocated and considered as per this patent as franchisees/sub franchises off the master franchise as well as off the sub franchisees themselves..

"This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation provides new methods for banks, financial institutions and monetary funds to provide ethical loans finance including Islamic deposits and finance with no riba, interest or usury. Banks, financial institutions and monetary funds can earn the interest or usury using a different process which is an internal crypto currency block chain dependent process the minting of new coin and mining of transaction fees. This new method is made possible because of the latest technology inside the crypto currency wallet as well as external factors. Customer applies for a loan, bank approves the loan and at the same time the bank acquires bankcoin to the value of the loan. The bank then leverages the bank coin 2x as a number Ix goes to the pay for the bankcoin and the other goes to the borrower. The borrower makes repayments however it is only the principle that he owes as there is no interest or usury. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation concerns cryptographic currency for use in the finance industry. More specifically the present invention relates to the provision of cryptographic currency by banking or other such financial institutions for their everyday products such as deposit and term deposit accounts etc. The financial institution then mints/mines the cryptographic currency up to a certain percentage to pay the interest on the account etc. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation concerns cryptographic currency/digital mining assets/commodities for use in the stock/share/bond market industry. More specifically the present invention relates to the provision of cryptographic currency/digital mining assets/commodity stock/share/ bond innovation which fundamentally changes how the stocks/shares/bonds are discovered, issued, valuated and rated. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation that addresses what the stocks/shares/bonds now known as digital mining assets/commodities look like and how they are bought, sold and traded on a digital mining assets/commodities Blockchain exchange. It affects proof of ownership on the Blockchain, investor returns, earnings to shareholders, settlement speed and company strength etc. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain innovation is a new stocks/shares/bonds structure using digital mining assets/ commodities which are the actual stocks/shares/bonds in the start ups, businesses, companies and corporations which can then be bought/sold/traded on a new Blockchain shared ledger exchange/ platform. New start-ups and existing businesses/companies/ corporations can transition from their old stocks/shares/bonds structure in the existing stocks/shares/bonds market over to this new innovative digital mining assets/commodities stocks/shares/bonds structure on a new digital mining assets/commodities Blockchain exchange. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation makes it possible for investors/stakeholders to acquire principle digital mining asset/commodity in a start-up, business/company/corporation in both the primary and secondary market and let their principle digital mining asset/commodity secondary mine for them on exchange and/or off exchange. This is then a new innovative way for investors/stakeholders who would now be shareholders in this new structure to get a stable return on investment without having to sell their principle stocks/ shares/bonds back into the market place. They can simply sell what their start-up/business/company/ corporation principle digital mining assets/commodities stocks/ shares/bonds secondary mine. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation has the potential to completely reshape the Islamic Banking industry and drive huge improvements in market efficiency, settlement, security, regulatory, speed of transfer, ownership CIS, KYC, AML. We will use Bankcoin as our example of the digital mining assets/commodities which has had its principle Bankcoin mined and is now secondary mining a percentage from 1% onwards pa from the total amount in their Bankcoin digital wallet. Example: if you acquire 1000 Bankcoins it will secondary mine up to 10% pa which equals up to 100 newly mined Bankcoins pa. So when an investor/stakeholder acquires 1000 digital mining asset/commodity stocks/shares/bonds in a start up/business/company/corporation from the SharesX exchange for example, they will newly secondary mine 100 digital mining asset/ commodity stocks, shares, bonds per annum for the new shareholder. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain digital mining asset/commodity stocks/shares/bonds innovation assists with market stability being a fixed price with the option of a floating price above that, transparency as the Blockchain is decentralised, security of ownership as investors/shareholders have full control over their digital mining asset/commodity stocks/shares/bonds both online and offline in their own digital wallet, and minimising tax avoidance by increased transparency and regulatory oversight. This Islamic Banking Sharia Compliant Blockchain Innovation method/ process using crypto currency applies to and for entities, which require an income/revenue producing asset using any form of named/ renamed crypto currency, using any form of blockchain/chain process using the wallet which mints/mines new coin assets. This new method/ process makes it possible for an entity to acquire a (blockchain or any chain dependent) crypto currency asset to earn revenue, mint and mine new assets and currency, produce, acquire income for that entity and or on behalf of another entity.
