It handles both turbulent and piston-driven laminar flow, operating by cycles, with the continuous circulation of fluid. It employs a culture medium, or industrial operation or production fluids that containing their own microbiota, which is introduced into the load of the receiving body, thus the bioreactor is single phase. 5) The bioreactor comprises a support section for corrosimetric test coupons, where the coupons are in touch with the fluid under dynamic conditions, such as found in the fluid carrying pipelines, naturally promoting the formation of the microbial biofilm. Every so often, coupons are removed for analysis, thus permitting one to follow the kinetics of microbial biofilm development. 6) The bioreactor's operating conditions comprises a section in which there is sufficient turbulence for the fluid to homogenize and maintain a temperature of 20 to 80 ??C, necessary for the mesophilic or thermophilic microorganism's growth. Likewise, salinity can be in the range 2 to 200 ppm (NaCI) and the pH range from 2 to 10; the bioreactor's operating conditions conform to the physicochemical characteristics of the fluid from the industry to be assessed."

The bioreactor's configuration is a ?ǣbatch?ǥ type for turbulent and piston-driven laminar flow, operating by cycles, with the continuous circulation of fluid. A culture medium, or industrial operation or production fluids containing microbiota is introduced into the load of the receiving body, thus the bioreactor is single phase. The bioreactor comprises a support section for corrosimetric test coupons that are in touch with the fluid under dynamic conditions, such as found in the fluid carrying pipelines, naturally promoting the formation of the microbial biofilm. The coupons are removed for analysis to follow the kinetics of microbial biofilm development. The operating conditions comprise a section having sufficient turbulence for the fluid to homogenize and maintain a temperature of 20 to 80?? C. necessary for the mesophilic or thermophilic microorganism's growth. Salinity can be in the range 2 to 200 ppm (NaCl) and the pH range from 2 to 10; the bioreactor's operating conditions conform to the physicochemical characteristics of the fluid from the industry to be assessed."

Secure junctions between fluid lines and/or electrodes and tissue are essential for automatic controls and permanent nephrostomies and suprapubic cystostomies, for example, using synthetic materials. These can be made self-contained and fully implanted to treat one chronic condition, or represent but one module controlled as an axis or channel of control in an adaptive ambulatory hierarchical prosthetic disorder response system used to automatically coordinate the treatment of chronic comorbid disease. Such applications require prosthesis-to-native tissue junctions which are secure, immobile, unsusceptible to leaks or microbial intrusion, and require little if any maintenance. Connection for securely and least disruptively merging catheteric and native lumina is described in nonprovisional application Ser.

The inner layer comprises a third polymeric material which is soluble in intestinal fluid or gastrointestinal fluid, said third polymeric material being selected from an at least partially neutralised polycarboxylic acid and a non-ionic polymer. In embodiments in which the third polymeric material is a non-ionic polymer, the inner layer comprises at least one of a buffer agent and a base. The isolation layer comprises a non-ionic polymer which is soluble in intestinal fluid or gastrointestinal fluid. The outer is applied directly to the inner layer or the isolation layer using a coating preparation formed by combining the first polymeric material in an aqueous medium with a second polymeric material in an organic medium. Advantages of formulations according to the present invention include accelerated release of the drug when exposed to colonic conditions and reduction or elimination of a food and/or alcohol effect on drug release after administration."

"Methods of processing municipal solid wastes (MSW) are provided whereby concurrent enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation of wastes results in liquefaction of biodegradable components as well as accumulation of microbial metabolites. Liquefied biodegradable components are then separated from nondegradable solids to produce a bioliquid characterized in comprising a large percentage of dissolved solids of which a large fraction comprises some combination of acetate, ethanol, butyrate, lactate, formate or propionate. This bioliquid is, itself, a novel biomethane substrate composition, which permits very rapid conversion to biomethane. Methods of biomethane production are further provided using this bioliquid and using other biomethane substrate compositions produced by concurrent enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation of organic materials."
