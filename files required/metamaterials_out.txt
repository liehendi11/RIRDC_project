The sensor comprises a cover layer, a metal structure, a microfluidic channel and a substrate, wherein metamaterial metal structures are arranged on the opposite surfaces of the cover layer and the substrate, and the microfluidic channel is formed in a gap between the two surfaces; when terahertz waves are incident from the upper surface of the cover layer and emergent from the lower surface of the substrate, the metamaterial metal structures interact with electromagnetic waves with a specific frequency to achieve the locality enhancing effect on the electromagnetic waves around the metal structures; the dispersion relation shows that a resonance peak appears in a transmission spectrum, and the transmission rate at the resonance frequency is lowest. When a liquid sample is injected into the microfluidic channel, a change of the dielectric property of substances around the metamaterial metal structures causes excursion of the resonance peak in the transmission spectrum.
