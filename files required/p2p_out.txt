Specifically, in a typical embodiment, a broker system acts as an intermediary between publisher systems and subscriber systems in the pub/sub environment. Along these lines, the broker creates an administrative communication channel between known publisher systems and the broker system. Using this administrative communication channel, the broker system informs individual publisher systems about other publisher systems such that peer-to-peer communication channels between two or more publisher systems can be established. This can be accomplished using the broker system's knowledge of data being published by the individual publisher systems. Regardless, the publisher systems can then use information received from the broker system to: establish a P2P communication channel with one or more other publishers; identify a set of data that has commonality to the peers (and thus has a potential to be cached); and negotiate a caching schema/approach to store the data in a cache. The broker system may generate a set of cache key/unique identifiers and communicate the unique identifiers to at least one of the publisher peers, which will then share the unique identifiers among the peers.

If the PS receives an area event notification for the device camped on the same zone as the discoverer mobile, the PS requests location information for the device and uses returned location information to determine if the device is within a predefined proximity of the discoverer mobile. If the device is within a predefined proximity of the discoverer mobile, the PS sends a proximity alert message to the discoverer mobile."			US

The content delivery network provides a client, a P2P gateway server, and a Resource Name Server (RNS) within a computer-populated network. The RNS caches data resource locations within the computer-populated network and resolves resource requests with optimal data resource locations within the computer-populated network. The gateway server requests and receives optimal data resource locations via the RNS; requests and receives data files from the computer-populated network via the optimal data resource locations; and processing received data files for data file delivery to the client. The network thus enables an origin- agnostic data delivery method for optimally delivering select data files to an end user.

Prior to connecting to an AP, the STA employs pre-connection logic in the STA to identify likely safe and likely unsafe APs. Once the user connects to an AP, the STA connects first in an untrusted mode. In the untrusted mode, the STA uses the network connectivity provided by the AP to establish a secure connection to a network-based WLAN trust service for post-connection security checks. If the AP passes the post-connection security checks, the STA may allow other applications to access the network connection provided by the AP."			US

Pursuant to new methodologies and/or technologies provided herein the multiple independent networks self-organize, or otherwise assemble, as a federation of network peers. The network peers 204A, 204B, 204C, 204D cooperate to pool and/or merge resources to make available for the federation 200 a population of content objects. As members of the federation, each of the network peers undertakes responsibility for making available to other network peers a share of the population. The multiple independent networks establish connectivity and federate using an HRP protocol. Pursuant to the HRP protocol, the network peers allocate amongst themselves respective key ranges within a hash-value space of a hash function. The network peers employ an allocation strategy to guide allocation of the hash-value space. When one of the network peers 204C receives a content request 201 from a local end user 202, local router or another network, the network peer routes and/or forwards the content request over a backhaul or transit network 216C or any link not part of the peering network if the content request falls into the content-object population allocated to this peer. Alternatively, the network peer routes and/or forwards the content request 201 through another network peer for processing if a hash value calculated from the content request falls within a key range of a hash value space allocated to such network peer. Logically merging the multiple individual networks as a federation with the logically combined backhaul and/or caching resources of the network peers 204A, 204B, 204C, 204D, should result in an efficiency gain because of a higher cache-hit ratio, since the merged caching resources supports a larger population. Federating the multiple individual networks using the HRP protocol enables such logical merging of caching storage capacity and transit (or backhaul) transfer capacity of the multiple individual networks."

Examples are peer-to-peer applications, which allow groups of people to share pictures and text documents, and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) applications, which support groups of users in working together on a specific task. Group creation becomes especially difficult in a mobile setting when mobile users need to interact in often short-lived groups using their mobile communications devices. The formation of groups typically requires users wishing to invite others to join the group to transfer information about the group to the invitee. We enable this by presenting a sequence of dynamically generated visual tags, such as one-dimensional bar codes, glyphs, text, or 2D encrypted tags using a communications device that is a member of the group. An invited user initiates a camera application on her/his mobile device and decodes images of the visual tags in real time. Information about the group is contained in the tag, such as the identity of one or more existing members, identity of an application making use of the user group, information about a peer group management operation to be carried out, information about the error detection algorithm used to protect the tags, and information about the number and sequence of tags. By transmitting information about multiple group members using dynamically generated tags the group creation process becomes more reliable, enabling mobile devices to deal with connectivity restrictions such as firewalls and network address translators.

When a viewer of the movie wishes to skip a portion of the movie containing the ad, the playback system determines whether the ad is static or dynamic. If the ad is static, then only the portion of the movie preceding the static ad can be skipped, that is, the ad is unskippable; this technique is referred to as “bounceback” since the end of the skip bounces back to the start of the static ad. If the ad is dynamic, then the ad is moved to after the end of the skip; this technique is referred to as “slipad” since the ad slips to later in the movie. When a movie has multiple ads, some can be static and some can be dynamic."			US

It can be used for the implementation of automated processes such as device/system control, process control, distributed computing and storage and others. The invention provides a solution which uses a blockchain to control a process executing on a computing resource.

The computing resource continuously monitors the state of the blockchain as well as any other off-blockchain input data or source. The execution of the loop is influenced by the state of the blockchain. Each iteration of the loop that is executed by the computing resource is recorded in a transaction that is written to the blockchain. It is stored as a hash within the transaction's metadata. If the computing resource finds a transaction which contains a hash relating to the loop it accesses the relevant portion of code. The loop contains a conditional statement which enables the computing resource to decide which action to take. The condition may be dependent upon the state of the blockchain or any other data source. The action can be any type of action, on or off the blockchain.
